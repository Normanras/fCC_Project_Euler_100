## I'm beginning free Code Camp's Project Euler Challenge! 

# 

### Here's an explanation:üë®üèº‚Äçüíª

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is a website created back in 2001. It hosts a collection of around 600 different algorithm problems that get progressively harder, to the point where even people with math PhD degrees still struggle with them.

This said, the first 100 problems are totally do-able by a new developer. Thousands of people have completed the first 100 Project Euler problems over the years.

*These will really wrack your brain.* But they will be rewarding. They are hard, but fair. And if you are willing to swallow your pride and go down a few Wikipedia rabbit holes, you can solve them, too.

# The Rules of the #ProjectEuler100 Challenge

I've boiled everything down to these 6 simple rules all participants must follow.

1. Tweet out a photo of yourself giving a thumbs-up and announcing that you are committing to the #ProjectEuler100 challenge.
Create a GitHub repository.

2. Each time you complete a challenge, add your solution to your GitHub repository and tweet a link to it using the #ProjectEuler100 hashtag.
Then scroll through the #ProjectEuler100 hashtag and give supportive feedback on at least 2 tweets from other developers.
3. Move on to the next Project Euler challenge. You can't skip ahead. You have to complete all 100 problems in order. But you can use any programming language you want to solve these.

4. Once you've finished all 100 of them, tweet out a celebration photo of yourself with your laptop open to your GitHub repo.
